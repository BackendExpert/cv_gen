        <p className="my-6 text-pink-600">An ATS-friendly CV creator is an essential tool for modern job seekers, ensuring that resumes pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used by recruiters and hiring managers. Many companies rely on ATS to filter and rank candidates based on their resumes, meaning that a poorly formatted CV can be rejected before it even reaches a human recruiter. Our CV creator is designed to optimize resumes by using industry-approved formatting, keyword optimization, and clear, structured content that enhances readability for both ATS and hiring professionals.</p>

        <p className="my-6 text-blue-600">With our easy-to-use platform, job seekers can quickly create a professional CV by selecting from ATS-friendly templates, entering their details, and receiving AI-powered suggestions for improvement. The system ensures that resumes include the right structure, standard fonts, and relevant keywords, avoiding common formatting issues such as tables, columns, or graphics that can confuse ATS software. Additionally, our tool provides real-time feedback, offering an ATS score to help users understand how well their resume performs against automated screening systems.</p>

        <p className="my-6 text-pink-600">This platform is ideal for a wide range of users, including fresh graduates, experienced professionals, career changers, and freelancers, who need a resume that stands out in a competitive job market. By allowing job seekers to customize their CVs for different job applications, the tool increases the chances of landing interviews. Additional features, such as AI-driven content suggestions and a cover letter builder, further enhance the user experience, making it a comprehensive solution for resume building.</p>
